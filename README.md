# Luca (a 48 key handwired wireless ergonomic keyboard)


### Attempted changes

#### Larger trackball
Love it


#### Home Row Mods
* Need more usage to decide.

### Case design changes from Pentangeli

* Lower thumb cluster.
  Initially, it feels stretched too far out, and a bit low. Could just be adjusting.
* Hillside PCBs.
  Nope. Millmax, PCBs aren't glued, diodes are brittle, etc. Stick to the 3DP sockets
* Adding lower keys: Yes, must have.

#### 6th column
* TBD

### Displays

* YAGNI, or just on the left (primary half)

### 35g Ambients
TBD
